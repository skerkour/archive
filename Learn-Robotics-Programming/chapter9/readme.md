# Setup

You should already have SPI enabled as mentioned in chapter 7.

For the apa102 LEDs you will need the SPIdev library installed:
    
    pi@myrobot:~ $ pip install spidev

# LED Shim

To use the Pimoroni LED Shim, you will need to set that up first.

    pi@myrobot:~ $ curl https://get.pimoroni.com/ledshim | bash
