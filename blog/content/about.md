# About
<!--
We believe that entropy (which can be defined as a measurement of chaos, complexity) is inevitable, and equilibrium is death.
As product designers, developers, entrepreneurs, managers... it's our role to manage complexity.
We share on this blog our ideas and experience on how we tackle entropy and keep things simple. -->

<!-- Sometime, it's the lack of entropy that can be fatal: in cryptography or in lottery for example. Anyway -->

The best way to survive is not to die.

It's far easier to add entropy (chaos) to our lives rather than removing it.
However, it's reducing entropy (decluttering) that brings the more happiness and value.

<!-- Equilibrium is death and too much entropy (chaos) is fatal. -->

In this blog we explore how complexity and chaos infiltrate systems, organizations and organisms and lead to a slow and painful demise.


Entropy is an important part of our lives and if you don't control it, it will control you.
