## Overview

On first launch, user is asked for contacts update.
* If granted, all contacts are imported in Bloom contacts
* Else, nothing is done.

Then each time a conatct is saved,
* if permission is granted, also save on device
* else, only save in Bloom

There is also an option in settings to import contacts (from sim, device or vcf file, JSON),
and to export contacts (vcf file, JSON).

Display if an user is verified (or not).
