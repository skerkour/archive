## On device encryption

Data stored on device are encrypted. Encyption keys are stored in the device secure KeyStore ([KeyStore](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore) on Android, and [Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services) on IOS), for whatever it's worth.


## Encryption in transit

Connection between clients and server and between servers and servers is encrypted using [INSERT PROTOCOL AND VERSION].
Please note that Bloom's threat model accept that this encryption in transit is insecure.
