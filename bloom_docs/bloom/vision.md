The future tech is not HTML and webapps whether it please ad networks or not.

A better looking future is better (federated) protocols.

For example, one protocol for blogging (Medium), one protocol for messaging (WhatsApp), one protocol for microblogging (Twitter).

And apps that can read data from multiple providers/instances (Like Mastodon).
