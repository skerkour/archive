Whether you are an aspiring employee, a contributor, a journalist, a youtuber, an investor or even
a competitor, this guide is for you.

**It's Bloom's sacred book**.

It contains **all** you need to know about the vision, how we run the organization, the projects management, the specs,
and even resources to improve your engineering/management/finance/... skills, backed by real life experience.


All employees and contributors are expected to improve The Guide whenever they notice something wrong.
Please use [issues](https://gitlab.com/bloom42/the_guide/issues) and
[merge requests](https://gitlab.com/bloom42/the_guide/merge_requests) for this purpose.
