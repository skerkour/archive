# Bloom UX

Which OS will win the convergence race?

Android (/e/, MaruOS, Samsung DEX)?
Linux (PureOS, AnBox, Plasma Mobile)?
or another (micro kernel based) OS (Fuschia, HarmonyOS)?

Android have by far the largest app catalog so far, and a good security model regarding apps access
to system resources.

Linux is the simplest, and have greate dev resoruces like Gtk, Qt and can run Android apps using a layer
like AnBox or *a la* ChromeOS.


Other OS support Android Apps and may be more appropriated for resoruce constrained environements
like IoT...


packages: Using ONLY the package manager, semver
