--------


`crypto42-rs` is cross-platform, secure, easy to use, and hard to misuse cryptographic library in Rust,
using [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) as backend.

This document presents the high level design of the library, you can find detailed code documentation here: https://bloom42.gitlab.io/libs/crypto42-rs/crypto42

The goal of `crypto42-rs` is to keep it's API surface as minial as possible and to implement the less ciphers
as possible.

Only safe to use/implement ciphers are available in `crypto42`.


## Primitives

- Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (primitive: AEAD)
<!-- - Streaming Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (primitive: -->
<!-- Streaming AEAD) -->
- One-way hash functions (primitive: HASH).
- Key Derivation Functions (primitive: KDF)
<!-- - *deterministic* authenticated encryption with associated data (primitive: -->
<!-- Deterministic Aead) -->
<!-- - message authentication codes (primitive: MAC), -->
- Public-key signatures (primitive: SIGN)
<!-- - hybrid encryption (primitives: HybridEncrypt and HybridDecrypt). -->

| Primitive          | Algorithms                            |
