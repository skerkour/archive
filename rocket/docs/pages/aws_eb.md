# AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Description

The `aws_eb` provider is a helper to deploy to the [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/elasticbeanstalk/)
service.

It does not aim to have all the `eb` CLI functionalities but to provide a standard and easy way
to create releases.

It will proceed the following steps:

1. ZIP the given directory
2. upload the `bundle.zip` to the given S3 bucket
3. create a new Application version

**Note**:  if `access_key_id` or `secret_access_key` is empty, even after environment expanded
and default values filled, the `aws_s3` provider will use the *shared credentials file* (`~/.aws/credentials`)
and if empty the *EC2 instance role credentials*.

The recommend way is by setting the **$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** and **$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** environment
variables.
